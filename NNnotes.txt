we need a model.py file and a train.py file. 
model will take as input 3x96x128 image and output steering value in range -1
to 1 (we will have to scale to appropriate value)

model.py:
    -need to choose nonlinearity (ELU)
    -need to choose optimization method
    -need to choose loss function (mean squared for continuous output?)
    
train.py:
    -load data, compute metrics (mean and variance)
    -shift, scale with mean and variance, so that data has mean 0, variance 1
    -partition into training, validation? (could just train with all data,
    test by driving)
    -randomize data!
